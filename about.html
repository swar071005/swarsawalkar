 <h1>About Me</h1>

  <em>
    “A journey rooted in sur, discipline, and devotion — shaped by tradition,
    inspired by legends, and evolving with sincere riyaz.”

<!-- ABOUT CONTENT -->
<section class="section">


  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<p>
  I am <strong>Swar Sawalkar</strong>, a seeker of Indian classical music,
  where melody meets discipline and emotion finds its voice.
  Music, for me, is not an act of performance,
  but a lifelong path of listening, learning,
  and evolving through every sur and sam.
</p>


  <!-- EARLY MUSICAL INFLUENCE -->
  <h3>🎶 Early Musical Influence</h3>
  <p>
    From the very beginning of my musical journey, I have closely followed and absorbed
    the styles of legendary Indian classical and light music exponents. I grew up
    listening to maestros such as <strong>Bharat Ratna Pt. Bhimsen Joshi</strong>,
    <strong>Pt. Jitendra Abhisheki</strong>, <strong>Swar Kokila Lata Mangeshkar</strong>,
    and <strong>Asha Bhosle</strong> and many others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Listening to these great artists inspired me to observe their voice culture,
    phrasing, emotional depth, and discipline. I would often attempt to imitate their
    styles and renditions as a learning exercise, helping me develop sensitivity
    towards sur, laya, bhava, and clarity in singing.
  </p>

  <!-- Early Training, Listening & Musical Journey-->
  <h3>🎼 Early Training, Listening & Musical Journey</h3>
<p>
  My journey in music began at home. I was first introduced to music by my mother,
  who herself is a music teacher. Observing my inclination and interest in music
  from an early age, she encouraged me to pursue formal training and took me to
  <strong>Pt. Smt. Vidya Jail</strong>, a respected disciple of
  <strong>Sangeet Samragini Begum Parveen Sultana</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Under her guidance, I received a strong foundation in Hindustani classical music,
  focusing on riyaz, voice culture, and emotional expression. During this phase,
  I received several opportunities to perform on various platforms, including
  devotional venues and cultural programs. I was also featured on television
  channels such as <strong>Zee TV</strong> and <strong>Star Plus</strong>,
  which gave me early exposure to professional performance environments.
</p>

<p>
  Through a reference from <strong>Mrs. Sreerupa Ghosh</strong>, who has been my
  coordinator for several years, I was introduced to the professional music industry.
  Under her guidance, I was launched into voice-over and dubbing work, allowing me
  to explore music beyond stage performances and gain experience in studio-based
  vocal work.
</p>

<p>
  As my musical journey progressed, I began advanced training under the guidance of
  <strong>Mahesh Kale</strong>, a renowned Hindustani classical vocalist and disciple
  of <strong>Pt. Jitendra Abhisheki</strong>. Under his mentorship, I continue to
  deepen my understanding of classical aesthetics, gayaki, and expressive nuance,
  and I remain a dedicated student to this day.
</p>


  <!-- BOLLYWOOD & LIGHT MUSIC -->
  <h3>🎼 Listening & Musical Taste</h3>
  <p>
    Alongside classical music, I have a strong inclination towards Hindi film music,
    especially melodies from earlier decades. I regularly listen to evergreen
    Bollywood songs, which have played an important role in shaping my musical
    understanding and expression.
  </p>
  <p>
    My favourite playback singers include <strong>Kishore Kumar</strong> and
    <strong>Mohammed Rafi</strong>, whose versatility, tonal balance, and emotive
    storytelling continue to inspire me deeply. I also explore works of several other
    legendary singers to understand vocal dynamics across genres.
  </p>

  <!-- MUSIC COMPOSITION INTEREST -->
  <h3>🎧 Interest in Music Composition</h3>
  <p>
    Apart from singing, I have a keen interest in music composition and musical
    arrangement. I actively listen to works of various iconic music directors to
    understand melodic construction, orchestration, and mood creation.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of my greatest inspirations in composition is <strong>R. D. Burman</strong>,
    whose innovative use of harmony, rhythm, and instrumentation fascinates me.
    I also deeply admire composers such as <strong>Kalyanji–Anandji</strong>,
    <strong>Naushad Ali</strong>, <strong>Madan Mohan</strong>,
    <strong>S. D. Burman</strong>, and many others who have contributed timeless
    melodies to Indian music.
  </p>

  <!-- FORMAL TRAINING -->
  <h3>🎼 Musical Training</h3>
  <p>
    I receive formal training under <strong>Guru Vidya Jail</strong>, a respected
    disciple of <strong>Sangeet Samragini Begum Parveen Sultana</strong>.
    Under her guidance, my training emphasizes riyaz, voice culture, clarity of notes,
    emotional depth, and a strong foundation in Hindustani classical tradition.
